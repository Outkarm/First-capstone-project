        The precursor to Marvel Comics was founded in 1939 by pulp magazine
        publisher Martin Goodman. In order to capitalize on the growing
        popularity of comic books—especially those starring superheroes—Goodman
        created Timely Comics. Timely’s first comic book was Marvel Comics no. 1
        (cover dated October 1939), which featured several superhero characters,
        most notably the Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner. Timely Comics
        introduced many superhero characters during comics’ “Golden Age” in the
        1940s, most importantly Captain America, who first appeared in Captain
        America Comics no. 1 (March 1941). Timely characters were often
        portrayed as fighting against the Nazis and the Japanese even before the
        United States entered World War II. As the 1940s came to a close,
        superheroes fell out of vogue with comic book readers, and Timely
        canceled the last of its books in this genre in 1950. In 1951 Goodman
        formed his own distribution company, and Timely Comics became Atlas
        Magazines. Though there was a brief experiment in bringing back
        superheroes such as Captain America in 1953, Atlas’s output was mostly
        in other genres such as humour, westerns, horror, war, and science
        fiction.

          On a red-filtered background, we see a series of Marvel comic book
          panels flipping downward second by second like a flipbook. "MARVEL",
          now in its current logotype, zooms out, fading in as a black outline.
          As the panels fade into a simple red gradient background, the "MARVEL"
          logo fades into a solid white color. As the background is finished,
          "MARVEL" continues to zoom away as the logo fades out.
